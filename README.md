This repository contains images from the "Tehran, 4 Emotions" exhibition held on Friday, December 22, 2017. I managed this exhibition, and personally designed the maps. (Read the full story on [this tweet](https://x.com/mohsentaleb/status/1870206782825517287))

The exhibition created an interactive experience for visitors by asking them to place colored pins representing emotions (Sadness, Happiness, Love, Fear) on a giant map of Tehran. The aim was to create an emotional map of the city, based on the feelings of those who participated.

- **Main Concept**: A large map of Tehran (5x3 meters) was printed with high-quality details, allowing visitors to pinpoint their feelings in specific locations across the city. Four different colored pins represented the emotions of Sadness, Happiness, Love, and Fear.
- **Reception**: The exhibition was very well-received, with over 1000 visitors daily, surpassing expectations.
